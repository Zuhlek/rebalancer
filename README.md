This rebalancing tool helps calculate the necessary investments required to achieve your target allocation in your portfolio.

I use this tool for my annual rebalancing of my ETF world portfolio. It's pretty simple, and I thought others might be interested in using it as well.

# How to Use It
1. Add rows for each new portfolio item and specify the details.
2. Assign the target allocation based on your investment plan.
3. Once all required items are set, enter the new planned investment amount at the top.
4. Hit 'Calculate' to see the required investment for each item.

# Storage Option as .txt
You can download your current portfolio items as a simple .txt file and upload it later for reuse. This way, you won't have to manually create all items every time.

# Contribution
I never planned to make this repository/application public, but here we are. Unfortunately, the terminology is not in English, and the layout is also quite unorganized. In the end, it does its job. Nevertheless, feel free to clone, fork, or contribute with pull requests as you see fit :)

Cheers
